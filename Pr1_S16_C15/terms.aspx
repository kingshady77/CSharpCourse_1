                                10.1 These Terms and the other policies posted on the Website constitute the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and AdsValley and govern your 
                                use of the Service and the Website superseding all prior understandings, proposals, agreements, negotiations, and discussions between the parties, whether written or oral. 
                                The Terms and the relationship between you and AdsValley shall be governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates without regard to its conflict of law principles. 
                                We encourage you to contact AdsValley to try and settle any claim you may have, however, if we cannot settle the dispute amicably through human negotiation, 
                                then the claim or dispute must be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the United Arab Emirates. 
                                The failure of AdsValley to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 
                                If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid (including, without limitation, because such provision is inconsistent with the 
                                laws of another jurisdiction) or inapplicable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision. 
                                If any provision or provisions of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the 
                                Terms shall not in any way be affected or be impaired. You agree that any cause of action brought by you and arising out of or related to your use of the service and/or 
                                the website must commence within a reasonable time and in any event within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. 
                                These Terms shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each party's successors.
